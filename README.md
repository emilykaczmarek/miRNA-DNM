# miRNA-DNM
Application of Deep Neural Maps (Pesteie et al., 2018) for microRNA-based cancer clustering and interpretation. 
Original code and paper can be found at https://github.com/mpslxz/DNM. The only modifications to this code are the updated autoencoder architecture for 1D data (miRNA_AE) and the code for the activation gradients (second cell of the DNM.ipynb file)

The .ipynb file can be downloaded and it is recommended to run this file in Google Colab.

A full list of required packages and versions can be found in Google Colab by running the following command:
