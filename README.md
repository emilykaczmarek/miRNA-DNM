Application of Deep Neural Maps (Pesteie et al., 2018) for microRNA-based cancer clustering and interpretation. Original code and paper can be found at https://github.com/mpslxz/DNM. The code has been modified for application to miRNA sequence data, the autoencoder architecture for 1D data (miRNA_AE) is updated and activation gradients are added (second cell of the DNM.ipynb file). This code has been converted to a notebook (.ipynb) from the original python file.


It is recommended to run DNM.ipynb in Google Colab. Otherwise, a full list of required packages and versions can be found in Google Colab by running the following command: !pip list -v
